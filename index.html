                <h2>Enter the Sobiverse if you dare...</h2><br>
                <p>I've always been an avid writer but I've never created a blog before so I decided to do so. <br><br>I think writing is more powerful than the Hulk and Thor's Mjölnir hammer combined. I think everyone's thoughts are cool and significant, someone could one day be the inventor of a time machine or figure out a way to record and play back dreams or discover how to eat a bowl of tomato soup using telekinesis. Writing and reading give you the ability to take your mind somewhere impossible. I hope you enjoy this but if it's not your cup of chai, you're welcome to delve into your own fictional universe. I'm sure it'll be more thrilling than mine anyway.</p>

              <p>You don't need to dilute your imagination like it's Robinson's, orange-flavoured-single-strength-diluting juice. Drink it with no water to activate your creativity. (Erm... *proceeds to inadvertently cause a sea of orange Robinson's juice to be sprayed out, causing the oceans to turn into orange juice*)</p><br>

              <p>SAIL YOUR CARDBOARD SUBMARINE WITH YOUR FRIENDS! This may sound like an advert haha but I can assure you it is not. You have the means to build one if you want to.</p><br>
